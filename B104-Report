1. Introduction

1.1 Problem Statement and Research Motivation

Due to environmental concerns, climate change, and the need for sustainable energy security, the demand for renewable energy has increased dramatically on a global scale. Due to policy support and declining technology costs, solar power is becoming recognised as a key player in the global clean energy transition. However, there are significant regional differences in the growth rates of solar electricity, which begs the question of whether some regions are progressing more quickly than others. Comprehending these distinctions is essential for forecasting trends in energy development and guiding future investment and policy choices. According to earlier studies, regional variation analysis can reveal differences in solar adoption and direct strategic planning for renewable energy.

1.2 The Dataset

The "modern-renewable-energy-consumption" dataset, which tracks global renewable energy indicators by region over time, is used in this study. Only data pertaining to the production of solar electricity, expressed in terawatt-hours (TWh), for the regions of Europe and Asia Pacific were extracted for this project. The dataset allows for a direct comparison of the trends in solar electricity generation between the two regions and offers a continuous time-series spanning several decades.

1.3 Research Question

"Is there a difference in the mean solar electricity generation between Europe and Asia Pacific?" 
is the research question for this study. The study looks at whether one area regularly produces more solar energy than the other.




1.4 Hypotheses

H₀ (Null hypothesis): There is no difference in the mean solar electricity generation between Europe and Asia Pacific.
H₁ (Alternative hypothesis): There is a difference in the mean solar electricity generation between Europe and Asia Pacific.
A hypothesis test was employed to compare the mean solar electricity generation between the two regions in order to statistically assess the research question. According to the null hypothesis (H₀), the mean solar electricity generation in Europe and Asia Pacific is the same. According to the alternative hypothesis (H₁), the two regions' mean solar electricity generation differs significantly. To determine whether the observed differences in sample means represent true regional variation or are merely the result of random variation in the data, a two-sample Welch t-test is used.

2. Background Research

2.1 Research Papers

The growth of solar power generation in various parts of the world has been the subject of numerous studies. According to IRENA (2022), solar adoption has grown exponentially globally due to rapid technological advancements and declining photovoltaic costs. However, deployment trends differ significantly between Europe and Asia Pacific because of different investment priorities and policy frameworks. According to Haegel et al. (2019), Asia Pacific has recently surpassed Europe in installed capacity due to extensive solar expansion in nations like China and India, despite Europe being an early leader in solar deployment, particularly through widespread feed-in-tariff programs. In a related study, Mints (2021) examined regional competition in solar markets and discovered that while European growth has stabilised following ten years of early expansion, Asia Pacific has shown faster year-to-year increases in solar electricity output. When taken as a whole, these studies show that while both regions exhibit robust solar adoption trajectories, the development timeline, speed, and scale are different. In order to track these variations and determine whether one region exhibits statistically greater energy output than the other, an empirical comparison of solar electricity generation levels between Europe and Asia Pacific is helpful. 

2.2 Why the RQ is of Interest

Prior studies show different patterns of solar development, but they do not definitively establish if the mean electricity generation in the two areas differs significantly. There is a lack of knowledge regarding whether actual energy production varies significantly between regions because the majority of studies evaluate installation capacity or investment levels rather than actual electricity output. Closing this gap is crucial because statistical validation of regional variations may guide the creation of energy policies, promote focused investments in renewable energy, and aid in long-term sustainability planning. Therefore, by offering a direct, data-driven comparison of solar electricity generation between Europe and Asia Pacific, the research topic expands on the body of previous literature.


3. Visualisation

3.1 Appropriate Graphs for the Research Question

In order to compare Europe and Asia Pacific, a line graph of solar electricity generation over time was created. This graph shows long-term trends and regional variations in magnitude. In order to facilitate the comparison of mean generation levels, histograms were incorporated to display the distribution of solar electricity values within each region.


3.2 Additional Information Relating to Understanding the Data
Both locations begin with very little solar electricity output, but over time, particularly after the 2000s, it rises rapidly, as the line graph demonstrates. Europe shows more gradual but continuous expansion, while Asia Pacific shows a stronger upward slope in later years. The statistical comparison is put in context by these visual patterns.
3.3 Useful Information for Data Understanding

With the majority of data clustered below 50 TWh and a few very high values in recent years, the histograms show that both distributions are strongly right-skewed. Compared to Europe, Asia Pacific exhibits more extreme upper-end values, which visually suggests stronger solar output but does not verify if the mean difference is statistically significant.

4. Analysis
4.1 Statistical Test Used and Output
A Welch two-sample t-test was used to see whether the mean solar electricity generation in Europe and Asia Pacific differed significantly. Since it does not imply equal variances and compares the means of two independent groups, this test is suitable. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean solar electricity generation between the two regions, according to the results, which showed a test statistic of t = 0.17568 with df = 91.161 and a p-value = 0.8609.

4.2 Decision Based on the p-Value and Interpretation
The null hypothesis cannot be rejected since the p-value of 0.8609 is significantly higher than the 0.05 significance level. This indicates that there is insufficient data to draw the conclusion that the average solar electricity generation in Europe and Asia Pacific is different. Despite the fact that Asia Pacific exhibits larger extreme values in subsequent years, there is no discernible statistical difference in mean generation due to the total variability within both datasets. Therefore, rather than a persistent difference between the two regions, observed discrepancies in sample averages are probably the result of random variation.

5. Evaluation – Group’s Experience at 7COM1079
5.1 What Went Well
Each member of the group contributed to the data analysis, interpretation, and report writing, and they all worked well together. In general, there was clear communication, and duties were distributed equitably according to individual strengths. The group improved their understanding of statistical testing and R programming, particularly with regard to datasets related to renewable energy. The final product demonstrated a common knowledge of the study issue, dataset, and analytical techniques, and weekly talks helped to guarantee progress.

5.2 Points for Improvement
The group occasionally had trouble organising task deadlines and reaching consensus, despite the fact that collaboration was generally effective. A better organised task distribution may have increased efficiency throughout the analysis stage, and earlier planning might have decreased last-minute workload. In order to keep everyone on the same page and informed on task expectations, future projects would also benefit from more frequent documentation of progress and additional brief meetings.

5.3 Group’s Time Management
Over the course of the project, time management gradually improved. Selecting the dataset and research question was a slow process at first, but after roles were allocated, the workflow became more structured. Establishing more precise goals early on could facilitate future project progress and prevent time constraints close to submission deadlines.

5.4 Project’s Overall Judgement
The project was successful overall. In order to answer the research question, the team generated insightful visualisations, used suitable statistical techniques, and accomplished the targeted study goal. The project demonstrated the value of preparation, teamwork, and consistent communication while working with actual datasets and statistical analysis.

5.5 Comment on the GitHub Log Output
The GitHub log demonstrates consistent contributions throughout the project's duration, providing proof of cooperation and shared accountability. The log, which is part of Appendix B, uses commit messages to show how the analysis and report evolved. To highlight key project modifications and their effects on the finished product, three noteworthy commits were chosen.

6. Conclusions
6.1 Results Explained
The mean solar electricity generation in Europe and Asia Pacific did not differ much, according to the statistical analysis. The overall averages over the entire dataset were not sufficiently different to be statistically significant, despite the visualisations indicating that Asia Pacific reached higher extreme levels of solar production in recent years. This finding implies that the development of solar electricity in both areas has followed essentially similar paths throughout time. 

6.2 Interpretation of the Results
The results show that natural variations rather than underlying differences in long-term generation levels can account for the variation in solar energy output between the two regions. The larger dataset reveals that both regions had comparable levels of solar electricity output on average, notwithstanding Asia Pacific's recent production boom. This suggests to stakeholders that Europe and Asia Pacific continue to make comparable contributions to the development of solar energy worldwide.

6.3 Limitations and Implications for Future Work
Only two regions are included in the study, and each region's dataset covers a distinct time period, which could affect the findings. To ascertain if the current increase in Asia Pacific would result in a statistically significant long-term divergence, future research might include other regions, examine the effects of policy, and use more sophisticated modelling.
